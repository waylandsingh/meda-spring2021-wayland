				<h1>The Free Craigslist Hobby</h1>
				<div id="text-content">
					<h2>Something about me & why I like this</h2>
					<p>
						My hobby is collecting free things from Craigslist free section and putting them to use or repairing them.
						I enjoy doing this because waste sucks! Also it's interesting and cool to see what objects have been through.
						I'm a tinker-er and enjoy learning about new types of systems: electronic, mechanical, chemical, etc. 
						Usually, on Craigslist, that means I pick up household appliances like vacuums, blenders, TVs, and bikes. 
						In addition, I've also scored some interesting project components like: a disassembled workbench parts, cabinet doors, and pieces of hardware.
					</p>

					<h2>Starting to be a free/lowcost craigslister:</h2>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>Release your expectations of anything but curiosity and figuring things out.</li>  
							<li>It's OKAY to decide things aren't worth your time; no need to be a hoarder</li>
							<li>Open up craigslist for your area and select 'Free Stuff' from the dropdown</li>
							<li>Ask questions and plan on cleaning up the items and checking if there are repairs needed when deciding to take opportunities</li>
							<li>Coordinate and pick it up - it's up to you and Google from here on out</li>
							<li>Consider putting your own useable and interesting items out there, you never know if someone else might get a kick out of it </li>
						</ol>
					</p>

					<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
					<p>
						Spinning the free Craigslist roulette is exciting, but should be undertaken with some caution. 
						Don't put yourself or anyone else in danger when picking up items; if something seems sketchy, it's best to bail out. 
						Furthermore, be aware of the items you are picking up. If there are hazards, or it seems like too too much of a headache, you should be ready to say nope at any point: there's always another interesting listing, but your roommates, parents, cat may not appreciate you causing (too much) of a mess.
