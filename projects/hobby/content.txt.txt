My hobby is collecting free things from Craigslist free section and putting them to use or repairing them.

I enjoy doing this because waste sucks! Also it's interesting and cool to see what objects have been through. Here I'll document a few things that I've found and what I like about them.

Starting to be a free/lowcost craigslister:
0. Release your expectations of anything but curiosity and figuring things out. 
0a. It's OKAY to decide things aren't worth your time; no need to be a hoarder
1. Open up craigslist for your area and select 'Free Stuff' from the dropdown
2. Get in contact with posters that pique your interest
	2a. don't be afraid to ask questions, and 
	2b. remember, being nice can go a long way - we're talking about people taking the time to give you FREE STUFF, but they're often happy to chat a bit 
3. Plan on cleaning up the items and checking if there are repairs needed when deciding to take opportunities
4. Coordinate and pick it up
5. Consider putting your own useable and interesting items out there, you never know if someone else might get a kick out of it
