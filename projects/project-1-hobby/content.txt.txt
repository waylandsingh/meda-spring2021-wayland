My hobby is collecting free things from Craigslist free section and putting them to use or repairing them.
I enjoy doing this because waste sucks! Also it's interesting and cool to see what objects have been through.
I'm a tinker-er and enjoy learning about new types of systems: electronic, mechanical, chemical, etc. 
Usually, on Craigslist, that means I pick up household appliances like vacuums, blenders, TVs, and bikes. 
In addition, I've also scored some interesting project components like: a disassembled workbench parts, cabinet doors, and pieces of hardware.


Starting to be a free/lowcost craigslister:
Release your expectations of anything but curiosity and figuring things out 
It's OKAY to decide things aren't worth your time; no need to be a hoarder
Open up craigslist for your area and select 'Free Stuff' from the dropdown
Ask questions and plan on cleaning up the items and checking if there are repairs needed when deciding to take opportunities
Coordinate and pick it up
Consider putting your own useable and interesting items out there, you never know if someone else might get a kick out of it 


Additional Considerations
Spinning the free Craigslist roulette is exciting, but should be undertaken with some caution. 
Don't put yourself or anyone else in danger when picking up items; if something seems sketchy, it's best to bail out. 
Furthermore, be aware of the items you are picking up. If there are hazards, or it seems like too too much of a headache, you should be ready to say nope at any point: there's always another interesting listing, but your roommates, parents, cat may not appreciate you causing (too much) of a mess.
