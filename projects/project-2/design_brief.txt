	body - White

ABOUT ME

Wayland Singh is a Fellow in Data Science at The Data Incubator. His interests include modelling the performance of engineering systems in agriculture, and is looking for ways to learn and apply machine learning techniques to interesting problems. He is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and is currently on the look out for opportunities. His skills include: Python, SQL and Web Development (learning in progress).

In his graduate work at UC Davis, he focused on developing a performance model for agricultural safety beacons to prevent aerial pesticide exposure incidents, as well as to reduce the chances of UAV/drone collisions. Other work and interests included utility cost savings, sustainable project scoping, and serving as a fabrication and project advisor for undergraduates. In his spare time, he likes to build and tinker with various household appliances: bikes, electronics, and anything fun that shows up on the free section of Craigslist. If you're interested in a curious, competent individual, consider reaching out.

E. Portfolio Likes/Dislikes
1. https://workdiary.de/
	Like: stark colors, cool animations (especially the cursor), minimalist, very clear content
	Dislike: body font choice is a bit difficult to read, animation changes the color of body midway through reading it, which can be jarring
	Sections: Header and footer are empty, with all items and animations in side the body, maybe because of animations/effects?

2. https://wholedesignstudios.com/
	Like: good structure, well spaced, good contrast, font sizes are good. Nice flow of content with scrolling articles as well.
	Dislike: nav bar isn't fixed (personal preferences)
	Sections: Header includes a nav bar and some cart-things. Body includes content (offers, sponsors, pictures, articles), Footer is mostly site navigation and a 'top of page button'

3. https://www.electricpulp.com/
	Like: Nice, minimal design with large, clear fonts, nice contact form in the footer.
	Dislike: Structure is a bit unclear; not sure what content is below the title. Some colored blocks peeking out behind sections in unexpected way. Low contrast color for some Footer text.
	Sections: Header has a navbar that is fixed (whoo!) with links to other important pages. Body has all the content. Footer has contact info and a contact form.
