            Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there was nothing to steal.
            Kyokan returned and caught him. "You may have come a long way to visit me, " he told the prowler, "and you should not return empty-handed. Please take my clothes as a gift."            
            The thief was bewildered. He tool the clothes and slunk away.
            Ryokan sat naked, watching the moon. "Poor fellow," he mused, "I wish I could give him this beautiful moon."

            Hoca had an ox with horns shaped like a bow. He had always wanted to sit between the horns and ride the ox but he was too afraid.
            One day he saw the ox sleeping, he approached it quietly and managed to sit between the horns but the animal was startled, it shook itself and threw Hoca to the ground. He fell on his head and was knocked out.
            When his wife saw him lying on the ground motionless she thought he was dead and began to cry. Soon Hoca opened his eyes again and consoled his wife saying "Don’t cry my dear, I tried hard and I got badly hurt but I finally did what I’d always wanted to do!"
